        Imagine you are out one evening and someone comes up to you demanding
        your wallet. They are not 20 feet from you...they are 4 feet. They say
        &quot;Move slowly!&quot; and they are keeping a close eye on your every
        movement. If you are carrying a regular concealed weapon, the likelihood
        that you will be able to get 20 feet of distance, get them heavily
        distracted or move with lightning speed to draw your weapon and protect
        yourself is highly unlikely. There is a good chance that even if you
        gave them a wallet, your life could still be in jeopardy.

        With the Curveball Holster, not only do you completely mask the outline
        of the weapon in your back pocket, but it allows you to be in close
        proximity to the threat to allow you to draw your weapon. Additionally,
        they do not need to be distracted and you can comply with their demands
        of moving slowly. For them, and unknowingly to them, the slower you move
        the better it is for you. It wont appear that you are going for a
        weapon, when the holster and weapon are slowly drawn out to allow you to
        discharge the weapon, they will have it in their mind that you are
        giving them a wallet, but instead you are throwing them a Curveball.
